# Movie Search Web Application

This is a ReactJS and Redux based web application that allows users to search for movies using an external API. Users
can search for movies by title (required) and year (optional) and see detailed descriptions of the movies by clicking
on the images. Users can rate movies using star ratings or add them to lists via toggle buttons beneath the images.
